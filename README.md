# JS-Guess-My-Number
Mini-JavaScript project where you can play a "guess my number" game on the web.

- Developed a fully interactive number-guessing game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, enabling users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20 with real-time feedback.
- Implemented dynamic DOM manipulation to update game state, messages, and styles based on user interaction, including score tracking and high score logic.
- Ensured responsive layout and engaging retro-style UI using custom CSS and Google Fonts to enhance user experience across devices.
